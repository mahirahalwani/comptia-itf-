## 1.0 - IT CONCEPTS AND TERMINOLOGY
- Computer Literacy: the ability to use computers and related technology efficiently, including understanding how they work and operate.
- Computer systems work similarly hence knowing one system helps learn another.
- Computing Process: Input, Processing, Output, Storage (same for every device)
- Input/Output devices enable communication with a computer enhancing capabilities of computers.
- Processing components handle commands.
- Storage devices save data and programs for later use.
- General-purpose computing devices, e.g., PCs, tablets, laptops, smartphones are adaptable, increasing their functionality and enables them to be more useful.
- Users can add apps to enable more functionality.
- Local Area Network (LAN): a basic computer network that connects devices within a limited area via switch. Local and usually small. Much faster. Server uses LAN to provide network.
- Wide Area Network (WAN): Routers connect one or more LANs into a WAN.
- Internet: LAN combined with WAN together.
- LANs, WANs, and the Internet are paths to reach remotely-accessed computer systems.
- Remotely-Accessed Computer Systems: allow users to access a computer from a distance, either for work or other purposes enhancing local capabilities.
- Remote Server: a computer that stores and processes information, and is accessible over the internet, e.g., web servers, database servers, file servers.
- Online applications enable lighter (resource-wise) local machines and it resides in the remotely-accessed computer systems.
- Online storage and systems protects data from local crashes.
- Specialized Computer Systems: computers that are designed to perform specific tasks, rather than a wide range of tasks e.g., POS System, ATM, GPS, printers, joysticks, multifunction devices.

## 2.0 - SYSTEM HARDWARE
- Central Processing Unit (CPU) is not smart but very fast. It only does what it is asked to do. Needs to give CPU a detailed instruction. Does not have memory, needs a separate memory piece to remember info.
- CPU's characteristic:
      - Speed: how many things it can do in one second under perfect condition. Measured in gigahertz (Hertz: 1 cycle per sec)
      - Complexity:
      - 32-bit or 64-bit processor (Bits: amount fo data a CPU can process)
      - e.g., Raspberry pi, mother board
      - n-core CPU: put n-different processors on one little chip and it works together.
- Electricity generates heat in the CPU while it works. 
- Methods to move heat:
      1) Passive: relies on air. Uses copper or aluminium structure called heat sinks that help heat dissipate into air.
      2) Active: using some kind of device to push or pull heat away from computing components e.g., fans/case fans (pull heat out into the air) or liquid cooling (pulls heat into fluid).
- Random Access Memory (RAM) is measured in gigabytes.
      1) Function: holds all active programming on a computer that includes OS running apps, and data. Only temporarily stores data.
      2) Capacity: The amount of usable RAM is called system memory. Using too much will slow it down not die.
      3) Adding More: Can add more RAM or replace with bigger RAM stick in bigger computers to increase the overall memory capacity.
      4) 32-bit only supports 4GB RAM.
      5) www.crucial.com: to find the right RAM for your device
 - Motherboard a.k.a. (Micro) Advanced Technology Extended (ATX) enables connectivity among devices directly or indirectly. Every computing device has a motherboard.
 - Power supplies:
      1) Power grid runs on alternating current (AC)
      2) Computing devices run on direct current (DC) so it relies on batteries for power.
      3) Power adapter: a.k.a. an AC adapter or charger, is a device that converts AC power from a wall outlet into DC power for a device.
      4) Power brick: a small, rectangular, external power supply that converts AC to DC to power electronic devices (for small devices).
      5) Power supply unit (PSU): a computer hardware component that converts AC from an electrical outlet into DC for a computer's internal components (for big devices).
- Intel vs AMD vs ARM processor:
    - Intel: expensive but awesome
    - AMD: great but less expensive
    - ARM: in little devices like smartphones

## 3.0 - DEVICE PORTS AND PERIPHERALS
- Peripheral device: a hardware component that connects to a computer to enhance its functionality, but is not part of the computer's core architecture.
- PS/2 Connector: connects to a very old mice and keyboards.
- Universal Serial Bus (USB): connects a variety of I/O device. There are 7 types of USB, e.g., USB A (plugs into a computer), USB Type-B (plugs into peripherals), USB Mini-B and USB Micro-B (plugs into smaller peripherals), Micro-B USB 3.0 (10 times faster), USB C (plugs in either way literally universal).
- eSATA Connector: connects external hard drive
- Video connector: HDMI, DisplayPort (mainly on Apple and Dell), VGA (for older monitor), and DVI connectors
- Ethernet (RJ-45) Connecter: connects networks
- Audio connectors are color coordinated: pink (microphone), black (other devices), green (speakers). It matters which one you plug in.
- Auto sensing port: automatically detects the connection speed and type of a device on the other end of the connection.
- On smartphones, all I/O devices are built into the same system.
- Scaling up devices adds a separation for the processing components.
- Computing devices come in many forms.
- I/O devices: touchscreens (input because of the touch function and output because of the screen monitor), keyboards, monitors, mice.
- Video cards can be added to desktop.
- VGA vs DVI vs HDMI: differences in quality of signal they carry and type of signals they carry.
        1) VGA - Default standard, supports a decent size resolution and only carries only video signals.
        2) DVI - Handles much better definition, carries only video signals.
        3) High Definition Multimedia Interface - carries high definition of audio and video.
- Buying a 5 bucks may or may not get the perfect connectivity and speed that the original cable provides.
