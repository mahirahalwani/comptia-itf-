## 1.0 - IT CONCEPTS AND TERMINOLOGY
- Computer Literacy: the ability to use computers and related technology efficiently, including understanding how they work and operate.
- Computer systems work similarly hence knowing one system helps learn another.
- Computing Process: Input, Processing, Output, Storage (same for every device)
- Input/Output devices enable communication with a computer enhancing capabilities of computers.
- Processing components handle commands.
- Storage devices save data and programs for later use.
- General-purpose computing devices, e.g., PCs, tablets, laptops, smartphones are adaptable, increasing their functionality and enables them to be more useful.
- Users can add apps to enable more functionality.
- Local Area Network (LAN): a basic computer network that connects devices within a limited area via switch. Local and usually small. Much faster. Server uses LAN to provide network.
- Wide Area Network (WAN): Routers connect one or more LANs into a WAN.
- Internet: LAN combined with WAN together.
- LANs, WANs, and the Internet are paths to reach remotely-accessed computer systems.
- Remotely-Accessed Computer Systems: allow users to access a computer from a distance, either for work or other purposes enhancing local capabilities.
- Remote Server: a computer that stores and processes information, and is accessible over the internet, e.g., web servers, database servers, file servers.
- Online applications enable lighter (resource-wise) local machines and it resides in the remotely-accessed computer systems.
- Online storage and systems protects data from local crashes.
- Specialized Computer Systems: computers that are designed to perform specific tasks, rather than a wide range of tasks e.g., POS System, ATM, GPS, printers, joysticks, multifunction devices.

## 2.0 - SYSTEM HARDWARE
- Central Processing Unit (CPU) is not smart but very fast. It only does what it is asked to do. Needs to give CPU a detailed instruction. Does not have memory, needs a separate memory piece to remember info.
- CPU's characteristic:<br>
      &emsp;- Speed: how many things it can do in one second under perfect condition. Measured in gigahertz (Hertz: 1 cycle per sec)<br>
      &emsp;- Complexity:<br>
      &emsp;- 32-bit or 64-bit processor (Bits: amount fo data a CPU can process)<br>
      &emsp;- e.g., Raspberry pi, mother board<br>
      &emsp;- n-core CPU: put n-different processors on one little chip and it works together.<br>
- Electricity generates heat in the CPU while it works.<br>
- Methods to move heat:<br>
      &emsp;1) Passive: relies on air. Uses copper or aluminium structure called heat sinks that help heat dissipate into air.<br>
      &emsp;2) Active: using some kind of device to push or pull heat away from computing components e.g., fans/case fans (pull heat out into the air) or liquid cooling (pulls heat into fluid).<br>
- Random Access Memory (RAM) is measured in gigabytes.<br>
      &emsp;1) Function: holds all active programming on a computer that includes OS running apps, and data. Only temporarily stores data.<br>
      &emsp;2) Capacity: The amount of usable RAM is called system memory. Using too much will slow it down not die.<br>
      &emsp;3) Adding More: Can add more RAM or replace with bigger RAM stick in bigger computers to increase the overall memory capacity.<br>
      &emsp;4) 32-bit only supports 4GB RAM.<br>
      &emsp;5) www.crucial.com: to find the right RAM for your device.<br>
 - Motherboard a.k.a. (Micro) Advanced Technology Extended (ATX) enables connectivity among devices directly or indirectly. Every computing device has a motherboard.<br>
![motherboard](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/66fcdc8f-6786-450e-8650-81d68a892167)
 - Power supplies:<br>
      &emsp;1) Power grid runs on alternating current (AC)<br>
      &emsp;2) Computing devices run on direct current (DC) so it relies on batteries for power.<br>
      &emsp;3) Power adapter: a.k.a. an AC adapter or charger, is a device that converts AC power from a wall outlet into DC power for a device.<br>
      &emsp;4) Power brick: a small, rectangular, external power supply that converts AC to DC to power electronic devices (for small devices).<br>
      &emsp;5) Power supply unit (PSU): a computer hardware component that converts AC from an electrical outlet into DC for a computer's internal components (for big devices).
- Intel vs AMD vs ARM processor:
    - Intel: expensive but awesome
    - AMD: great but less expensive
    - ARM: in little devices like smartphones

## 3.0 - DEVICE PORTS AND PERIPHERALS
- Peripheral device: a hardware component that connects to a computer to enhance its functionality, but is not part of the computer's core architecture.
- PS/2 Connector: connects to a very old mice and keyboards.
- Universal Serial Bus (USB): connects a variety of I/O device. There are 7 types of USB, e.g., USB A (plugs into a computer), USB Type-B (plugs into peripherals), USB Mini-B and USB Micro-B (plugs into smaller peripherals), Micro-B USB 3.0 (10 times faster), USB C (plugs in either way literally universal).
- eSATA Connector: connects external hard drive
- Video connector: HDMI, DisplayPort (mainly on Apple and Dell), VGA (for older monitor), and DVI connectors
- Ethernet (RJ-45) Connecter: connects networks
- Audio connectors are color coordinated: pink (microphone), black (other devices), green (speakers). It matters which one you plug in.
- Auto sensing port: automatically detects the connection speed and type of a device on the other end of the connection.
- On smartphones, all I/O devices are built into the same system.
- Scaling up devices adds a separation for the processing components.
- Computing devices come in many forms.
- I/O devices: touchscreens (input because of the touch function and output because of the screen monitor), keyboards, monitors, mice.
- Video cards can be added to desktop.
- VGA vs DVI vs HDMI: differences in quality of signal they carry and type of signals they carry.<br>
        &emsp;1) VGA - Default standard, supports a decent size resolution and only carries only video signals.<br>
        &emsp;2) DVI - Handles much better definition, carries only video signals.<br>
        &emsp;3) High Definition Multimedia Interface - carries high definition of audio and video.<br>
- Buying a 5 bucks may or may not get the perfect connectivity and speed that the original cable provides.

## 4.0 - DATA STORAGE AND SHARING
- Computing devices use wire and electricity to count in binary (base 2)
- 1 = ON, 0 = OFF
- every wire we added doubles the complexity
- modern operator comes in 32-bit and 64-bit
- 32-bit CPU/OS can hanfle up to 4GB of RAM
- RAM is volatile; it will erase its memory once it is off
- Mass storage device:<br>
      &emps;- It comes in many form each with variety of purposes, e.g., hard drive.
      &emsp;- Can be built into a computer, like an internal HDD or SSD
      &emsp;- Can attach storage devices, such as thumb drive or external HDD
      &emsp;- The internet hosts cloud storage options, such as iCloud and Dropbox
- Hard Drive: a device that provides long term storage. The data will be erased only if it is deleted or the hard drive dies and its capacity is measured in GBs and TBs.
- 1 digit = 1 bit, 8 bits = 1 byte, 1,204 bytes = 1 kilobyte, 1,024 KB = 1 MB, 1,024 MB = 1GB, 1,024 GB = 1TB
- Computing purpose determines capacisty needs, e.g. word processing apps do not take a lot of space while video editing does.
- Examples of Mass Storage Devices
      &emps;1) Internal Hard Drive: a storage device that's installed inside a computer's case and is directly connected to the motherboard and power supply, e.g., SSD (fast) or HDD.<br>
      &emps;2) Portable External Hard Drive: a storage device that can be connected to a computer or other device to provide extra storage space. Slower than SDD but portable and when need more space, it can be replaced with a bigger space.<br>
      &emps;3) Optical Media: a type of storage medium that uses a laser to read and write data on discs, e.g., CD, DVD, Blue-ray discs.<br>
      &emps;4) Mailing Flash Drive: sending a small, rectangular data storage device that uses flash memory through the mail.<br>
      &emps;5) Cloud Storage: a service that allows users to store data online and access it from any location using the internet or a private network, e.g. iCloud, dropbox.<br>
- Local storage vs network-attached storage:
      &emps;1) Local s
