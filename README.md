## 1.0 - IT CONCEPTS AND TERMINOLOGY
- Computer Literacy: the ability to use computers and related technology efficiently, including understanding how they work and operate- Computer systems work similarly hence knowing one system helps learn another.
- Computing Process: Input, Processing, Output, Storage (same for every device)
- Input/Output devices enable communication with a computer.
- Processing components handle commands.
- Storage devices save data and programs for later use.
- General-purpose computing devices, e.g., PCs, tablets, laptops, smartphones enable a variety of tasks.
- Users can add apps to enable more functionality.
- Local Area Network (LAN): a basic computer network that connects devices within a limited area via switch. Local and usually small. Much faster. Server uses LAN to provide network.
- Wide Area Network (WAN): Routers connect one or more LANs into a WAN.
- Internet: LAN combined with WAN together.
- Remotely-Accessed Computer Systems: allow users to access a computer from a distance, either for work or other purposes enhancing local capabilities.
- Remote Server: a computer that stores and processes information, and is accessible over the internet, e.g., web servers, database servers, file servers.
- Online applications enable lighter (resource-wise) local machines.
- Online storage and systems protects data from local crashes.
- Specialized Computer Systems: computers that are designed to perform specific tasks, rather than a wide range of tasks e.g., POS System, ATM, GPS,
